A script which extracts 1 or multiple tls/ssl certificates from a kubernetes cluster to PWD.
NOTE: Will not check the TLS certificate of the connecting kubernetes cluster as of the current time.
Switch --kubeconfig/-c <kubernetes kubeconfig file>. If not present default to ~/.kube/config
switch --namespaces/-n -- Namespace to dump certificates in. If not present, will dump certificates of all namespaces.
--context/-k -- The context to use in the kubeconfig file.
--dumpdir/-d -- Dump certificates to this directory instead of PWD
Will dump certificates in PWD in a directory with the name as the DNS to which the certificate belongs.
